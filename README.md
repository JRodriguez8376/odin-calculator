# odin-calculator
My attempt of the Calculator project from TheOdinProject. Done as HTML/CSS/JS review

Simple JS calculator hooked up to some simple HTML/CSS. Click the buttons to perform operations, and input operands.

Keyboard support is available as well. Each keybind is appropriately binded, with others such as Backspace deleting a number, and enter
being the equivalent to pressing space.

Overall, pretty easy project. I could've done much, much, better on the CSS, but I feels there isn't much to add here. It does the job, and for the calculator
portion itself, it's functional and pleasing to the eye. I've taken some liberties from the TheOdinProject in adding similar operations to the student example. The most difficult portion of the code was the logic for what actions to take given a specific keypress. I.E, if a user presses '=' when there is no numbers entered, and saving
values over multiple operations. Could've been done cleaner but it gets the job done.
